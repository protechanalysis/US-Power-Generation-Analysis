## Introduction/Problem Statement
In the realm of U.S. energy generation, a critical challenge revolves around understanding the intricacies of renewable energy production. This involves deciphering annual trends, major producer contributions, and the influence of top states on national renewable energy goals. The lack of such comprehension hampers effective decision-making and policy formulation.

This analysis employs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, focusing on renewable energy sources. The goal is to uncover insights into annual trends, major producer dynamics, and the impactful roles played by top states. A notable stride in this effort is the creation of a dynamic dashboard for real-time tracking of year-over-year growth.

Collectively, these endeavours aim to bridge the gap between complex data and informed decision-making. By providing actionable insights, the analysis seeks to empower decision-makers, industry stakeholders, and executives, guiding the nation toward a more sustainable, resilient, and strategically informed future in U.S. energy generation.
