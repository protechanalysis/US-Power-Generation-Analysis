        "\n",
        "The objective of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to gain insights into the trends of power generation in the United States from 2001-2021, with a focus on renewable. I aim to analyze the datasets, which include information on power generation across different states, types of producers, and energy sources. The primary questions I seek to answer are:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 1. Temporal Trends:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   How has the overall power generation evolved over the years?\n",
        "-   How has the overall renewable power generation evolved over the years? In comparison to nonrenewable power generation?\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 2. Energy Type Comparison:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   what is the total generation of different types of renewable energy sources?\n",
        "-   How does the contribution of different types of renewable energy sources vary over time? Are certain types of energy sources gaining prominence compared to others?\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3. Producer Sector Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   What is the total energy generated by the type of producer? Is there any noticeable trend?\n",
        "-   What is the sub-sector noticeable trend for the major type of producer?\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 4. State-wise Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Top 5 states in renewable generation?\n",
        "-   What are the trends in renewable power generation for each of the top states? Are there states that stand out in terms of consistent growth or fluctuations?\n",
        "-   What is the major renewable generation source for each of the top states?\n",
